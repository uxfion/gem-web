					A research team from Macao Polytechnic University (MPU) has won the ICME Ground Challenge 2024! They won the first place in Track 5 (Video Guidance) and Track 6 (Animal Behavior Recognition), demonstrating their excellence in multimodal video reasoning and analysis.<p></p>

In the competition, the MPU team successfully gained acceptance with two papers, “Enhanced Video Guidance by Dual-Channel Modal Fusion on the Animal Kingdom Dataset” and “Multimodal Behavior Recognition Networks with Interconnected Architecture”. Behind the success of these two papers is the hard work and teamwork of graduate students Chengpeng Xiong and Noel Long, co-supervised by Lecturer Yue Sun and Associate Professor Tao Tang from the College of Applied Sciences.<p></p>

This achievement not only recognizes the MPU team, but also highlights the excellence of Macao Polytechnic University in the cultivation of scientific and technological talents. Their outstanding performance will inspire more students to join the field of science and technology innovation and contribute to the advancement of science and technology.ICME Ground Challenge is an internationally recognized competition in the field of multimedia, and the victory of the MPU team has not only demonstrated their strength, but also gained international reputation for the Macau Polytechnic University. We are looking forward to their success in the future!<p></p>
