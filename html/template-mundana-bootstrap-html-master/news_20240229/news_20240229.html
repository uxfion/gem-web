					Macau Polytechnic University recently welcomed the visit of Professor Wang Shanshan, a researcher and doctoral supervisor of Shenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Professor Wang enjoys a high reputation for his in-depth research in artificial intelligence, medical imaging, radiomics and other fields. She received her double doctorate degrees from the University of Sydney and Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2014, and was included in Stanford's top 2% global scientists list from 2022 to 2024.<p></p>

During this visit, Professor Wang Shanshan shared her latest research achievements and academic views in the field of medical imaging with the teachers and students of the University, discussed the application prospects of artificial intelligence in the fields of medical imaging, radiomics and other fields, and introduced the latest progress of related technologies. Her academic report has brought profound inspiration and thinking to the teachers and students present.<p></p>

The teachers and students of Macau Polytechnic University expressed a warm welcome to Professor Wang Shanshan's visit.
