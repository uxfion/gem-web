				Good news for the GEM Lab at the Faculty of Applied Sciences of Macao Polytechnic University! We are honored to announce that four papers from the GEM Lab team have been early accepted by MICCAI (Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention), the top conference on medical imaging, marking that our excellent research results in the field of medical imaging have once again been highly recognized by our international peers.

					<p></p>

The four papers cover a wide range of topics, including important areas such as breast therapy, risk prediction, and NMR-based processing. Three of the papers were led by our team and the other was the result of active participation of our lab members. The early acceptance rate (Top11%) of these papers reached the top level of the MICCAI conference, adding to our research reputation in the field of medical imaging and contributing positively to the development of medical imaging technology. We will continue our efforts and dedication to promote the development of medical imaging technology and make greater contributions to human health.

				<p></p>
