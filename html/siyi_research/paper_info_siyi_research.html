				<div class="paper_title">Multi-Task Model for Chest CT Image Quality Assessment</div>
				<div class="paper_image"><img src="siyi_research.jpg" width="300px"></div>
				<div class="paper_time">Published Wed 06 September 2023</div>
				<div class="paper_info">With the rapid development of medical imaging technology, Computed Tomography (CT) has become one of the most commonly used imaging methods in clinic. At present, CT images have been widely used in clinical diagnosis of various diseases. At the same time, CT examination is also an important way of daily physical examination and disease screening. As a result, a large number of CT images are generated every day. However, a large number of non-homogeneous CT images bring difficulties to the storage and management of clinical diagnosis and medical data. Therefore, CT image quality assessment is of great significance.<p></p>

In recent years, with the continuous development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, using AI methods to automatically evaluate medical image quality has become a current research hotspot. This research will focus on developing advanced medical image quality assessment models, with a particular focus on deep learning-based CT image quality assessment methods. Specific research includes: 1) Multi-task model of chest CT image quality assessment and classification based on deep learning; 2) Chest CT image position and artifact detection and image quality assessment model based on deep learning; 3) Cross-modal medical image quality assessment model based on deep learning.<p></p>

This study aims to develop a good CT image quality assessment model by combining deep learning technology and image processing methods, so as to effectively identify and exclude low-quality images, help improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis, and help solve the storage and management of CT image data. Through this study, we hope to improve the accuracy of CT image quality assessment, promote the formulation of medical image quality standards and promote the interconnection of medical systems, so as to contribute to the development of medical image quality assessment.<p></p>
