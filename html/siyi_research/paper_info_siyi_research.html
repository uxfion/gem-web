				<div class="paper_title">Multi-Task Model for Chest CT Image Quality Assessment</div>

				<div class="paper_time">Published Wed 06 September 2023</div>
				<div class="paper_info">With the rapid development of medical imaging technology, Computed Tomography (CT) has become one of the most commonly used imaging methods in clinic. At present, CT images have been widely used in clinical diagnosis of various diseases. At the same time, CT examination is also an important way of daily physical examination and disease screening. As a result, a large number of CT images are generated every day. However, a large number of non-homogeneous CT images bring difficulties to the storage and management of clinical diagnosis and medical data. Therefore, CT image quality assessment is of great significance.<p></p>

In recent years, with the continuous development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, using AI methods to automatically evaluate medical image quality has become a current research hotspot. This research will focus on developing advanced medical image quality assessment models, with a particular focus on deep learning-based CT image quality assessment methods. Specific research includes: 1) Multi-task model of chest CT image quality assessment and classification based on deep learning; 2) Chest CT image position and artifact detection and image quality assessment model based on deep learning; 3) Cross-modal medical image quality assessment model based on deep learning.<p></p>

This study aims to develop a good CT image quality assessment model by combining deep learning technology and image processing methods, so as to effectively identify and exclude low-quality images, help improve the accuracy of clinical diagnosis, and help solve the storage and management of CT image data. Through this study, we hope to improve the accuracy of CT image quality assessment, promote the formulation of medical image quality standards and promote the interconnection of medical systems, so as to contribute to the development of medical image quality assessment.<p></p>

					In view of the problems existing in the non-homogeneity of CT image quality in clinical diagnosis and storage and management of medical data, scientific research on the following key issues is planned to focus on the development of effective automated CT-IQA datasets and models:
					<p></p>

					(1) Dataset<P></P>
					
						At present, there are few publicly available data sets for CT-IQA. Most of the existing data sets are simulated and synthesized by adding noise. The quality of simulation data is very different and easy to distinguish, but it cannot fully capture the physiological and anatomical differences between real patients, and it is difficult to accurately simulate the complex lesions and pathological conditions existing in the clinic. Therefore, we will make innovative use of real data collected from multiple medical institutions such as Shenzhen People's Hospital to build three datasets: 1) Chest CT image quality assessment dataset; 2) Chest CT body position and artifact assessment data set; 3) Cross-modal medical image quality assessment dataset. As far as we know, no such dataset currently exists, which would fill a gap in the field of medical data.
						<p></p>

					(2) A multi-task model for chest CT-IQA and classification is proposed for the first time. <P></P>

					The model is composed of backbone network, window and current classification module, assessment index regression module and quality assessment module modified by 3D VGG. This model can realize automatic classification and quality assessment of CT image window to a certain extent. To our knowledge, this is the first automated model to classify and evaluate the quality of CT images from different Windows..
						<p></p>
					
					(3)  The pipeline of chest CT image position and artifact detection and quality assessment was innovatively proposed to effectively assist clinical diagnosis. <P></P>
						
					The deep learning model is first used to make regression prediction of the missing anatomical structure caused by the body dislocation, and then the presence and degree of artifacts are detected. The combination of the two effectively supplements the quality information of CT images, to automatically evaluate the quality of CT images.
					
						<p></p>
					(4)  Innovative development of quality assessment models that can be used for different modes of medical images. <P></P>
						
					Based on the design model of global definition and local noise of medical images, the dual encoder structure of VGG improved by Hyper-conv and Swin-transformer is intended to be adopted for global and local feature extraction, and different modes are embedding as guidance information. It can improve network accuracy and generalization. The model enables automated quality assessment of medical images of multiple modes and anatomical sites. This will be the first universal quality assessment model for medical images of different modes.
