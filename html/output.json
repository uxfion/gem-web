    "abstract": "Recently, Users Generated Content (UGC) videos becomes ubiquitous in our daily lives. However, due to the limitations of photographic equipments and techniques, UGC videos often contain various degradations, in which one of the most visually unfavorable effects is the underexposure. Therefore, corresponding video enhancement algorithms such as Low-Light Video Enhancement (LLVE) have been proposed to deal with the specific degradation. However, different from video enhancement algorithms, almost all existing Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models are built generally rather than specifically, which measure the quality of a video from a comprehensive perspective. To the best of our knowledge, there is no VQA model specially designed for videos enhanced by LLVE algorithms. To this end, we first construct a Low-Light Video Enhancement Quality Assessment (LLVE-QA) dataset in which 254 original low-light videos are collected and then enhanced by leveraging 8 LLVE algorithms to obtain 2,060 videos in total. Moreover, we propose a quality assessment model specialized in LLVE, named Light-VQA. More concretely, since the brightness and noise have the most impact on low-light enhanced VQA, we handcraft corresponding features and integrate them with deep-learning-based semantic features as the overall spatial information. As for temporal information, in addition to deep-learning-based motion features, we also investigate the handcrafted brightness consistency among video frames, and the overall temporal information is their concatenation. Subsequently, spatial and temporal information is fused to obtain the quality-aware representation of a video. Extensive experimental results show that our Light-VQA achieves the best performance against the current State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) on LLVE-QA and public dataset.

    "abstract": "Objective: The objective is to develop a predictive model utilizing Support Vector Machines (SVM) for the purpose of classifying the clinical stage of breast cancer.Materials and Methods: Accurate determination of the clinical stage of breast cancer patients holds significant importance in selecting suitable treatment options and minimizing avoidable complications. In this study, we present the application of radiomics and SVM for breast cancer computed tomography (CT) to anticipate the preoperative clinical stage in breast cancer patients. The training dataset encompasses 166 cases obtained from the Affiliated Hospital of Xiangnan University, while the test dataset comprises 91 cases from Chenzhou Third People's Hospital. The integration of clinical parameters with radiomics exhibits the most superior diagnostic efficacy in forecasting the clinical stage of breast cancer. As part of the evaluation, various metrics were calculated, including the area under the curve (AUC), the accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). To differentiate between the radiomics model, clinical data model, and fusion model, the Delong test was utilized. The precision of the prediction model was evaluated by generating a calibration curve using 1,000 bootstrap weight samples. Furthermore, the decision curve analysis (DCA) was conducted to assess the model's practicality.Results: The fusion model exhibits superior predictive performance compared to both the single radiomics model and clinical model. The fusion model's test sets of AUC, ACC, Sen, Spe, PPV, and NPV are 0.824, 0.780, 0.932, 0.652, 0.707, and 0.909, respectively.Conclusion: The fusion model exhibits greater efficacy than both the single radiomics model and clinical model, and thus holds significant potential for facilitating the diagnosis of breast cancer stage and the development of individualized treatment plans.CCS",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer with the highest cancer occurrence in females. Handheld ultrasound is one of the most efficient ways to identify and diagnose the breast cancer. The area and the shape information of a lesion is very helpful for clinicians to make diagnostic decisions. In this study we propose a new deep-learning scheme, semi-pixel-wise cycle generative adversarial net (SPCGAN) for segmenting the lesion in 2D ultrasound. The method takes the advantage of a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) and a generative adversarial net to segment a lesion by using prior knowledge. We compared the proposed method to a fully connected neural network and the level set segmentation method on a test dataset consisting of 32 malignant lesions and 109 benign lesions. Our proposed method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.92 while FCN and the level set achieved 0.90 and 0.79 respectively. Particularly, for malignant lesions, our method increases the DSC (0.90) of the fully connected neural network to 0.93 significantly (p&lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\"&gt;$&amp;#x003C;$&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;alternatives&gt;&lt;mml:math&gt;&lt;mml:mo&gt;&amp;#x003C;&lt;/mml:mo&gt;&lt;/mml:math&gt;&lt;inline-graphic xlink:href=\"li-ieq1-2978470.gif\"/&gt;&lt;/alternatives&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt;0.001). The results show that our SPCGAN can obtain robust segmentation results. The framework of SPCGAN is particularly effective when sufficient training samples are not available compared to FCN. Our proposed method may be used to relieve the radiologists&amp;#x2019; burden for annotation.",

    "abstract": "Identifying mobile apps based on network traffic has multiple benefits for security and network management. However, it is a challenging task due to multiple reasons. First, network traffic is encrypted using an end-to-end encryption mechanism to protect data privacy. Second, user behavior changes dynamically when using different functionalities of mobile apps. Third, it is hard to differentiate traffic behavior due to common shared libraries and content delivery within modern mobile apps. Existing techniques managed to address the encryption issue but not the others, thus achieving low detection/classification accuracy. In this paper, we present MAppGraph, a novel technique to classify mobile apps, addressing all the above issues. Given a chunk of traffic generated by an app, MAppGraph constructs a communication graph whose nodes are defined by tuples of IP address and port of the services connected by the app, edges are established by the weighted communication correlation among the nodes. We extract information from packet headers without analyzing encrypted payload to form feature vectors of the nodes. We leverage deep graph convolution neural networks to learn the diverse communication behavior of mobile apps from a large number of graphs and achieve a fast classification. To validate our technique, we collect traffic of a hundred mobile apps on the Android platform and run extensive experiments with various experimental scenarios. The results show that MAppGraph significantly improves classification accuracy by up to 20% compared to recently developed techniques and demonstrates its practicality for security and network management of mobile services.",

We apply this combination to the problem of semi-supervised learning (SSL). Our study delves into the architecture of RMGANs, provides a mathematical analysis to assess the impact of margin utilization on RMGAN losses, and offers guidance on choosing hyper-parameters. We also conduct experiments across the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.

    "abstract": "There is a potential privacy breach when users access various location-based social applications on a mobile social network (MSN), e.g., sharing locations with friends. To preserve location privacy, one of the most common methods is to use a coarse or fake location instead of a user's exact location. However, most of these previous approaches only provide geometric strategies without considering the semantic context of the geographical locations. For example, if a cloaked region contains a part of a lake, where no boats are allowed, an adversary can easily prune the cloaked region to a smaller range covering a user's actual location.In this paper, we propose SALS, a semantics-aware location sharing framework based on cloaking zone for an MSN environment. By considering a user's social relations and activities which are available in an MSN environment, SALS does not assume any trustworthy entities, including strangers, friends or any third parties. As a solution, SALS enables users to cooperate with each other, in a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) way, to generate the cloaking zones, which will be used instead of the actual locations. Different from the previous cloaking techniques, SALS considers the semantic location which can influence the distribution probability of a user's locations. We also propose metrics for measuring the quality of the cloaking zone. The evaluation shows that our method can well defend the semantic-location attack.",

    "abstract": "Commodity information such as prices and public reviews is always the concern of consumers. Helping them conveniently acquire these information as an instant reference is often of practical significance for their purchase activities. Nowadays, Web 2.0, linked data clouds, and the pervasiveness of smart hand held devices have created opportunities for this demand, i.e., users could just snap a photo of any commodity that is of interest at anytime and anywhere, and retrieve the relevant information via their Internet-linked mobile devices. Nonetheless, compared with the traditional keyword-based information retrieval, extracting the hidden information related to the commodities in photos is a much more complicated and challenging task, involving techniques such as pattern recognition, knowledge base construction, semantic comprehension, and statistic deduction. In this paper, we propose a framework to address this issue by leveraging on various techniques, and evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of this framework with experiments on a prototype.",

MARSA is designed for environments where information technology (IT) infrastructures are not well developed but the need to gather and sell near-realtime data is great. To this end, we present techniques for selecting data types and managing data contracts based on different cost models, quality of data, and data rights. We design our MARSA platform by leveraging different data transferring solutions to enable an open and scalable communication mechanism between sellers (data providers) and buyers (data consumers). To evaluate MARSA, we carry out several experiments with the near-realtime transportation data provided by people in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, and simulated scenarios in multicloud environments.",

    "abstract": "Back-pressure-based adaptive routing algorithms where each packet is routed along a possibly different path have been extensively studied in the literature. However, such algorithms typically result in poor delay performance and involve high implementation complexity. In this paper, we develop a new adaptive routing algorithm built upon the widely studied backpressure algorithm. We decouple the routing and scheduling components of the algorithm by designing a probabilistic routing table that is used to route packets to per-destination queues. The scheduling decisions in the case of wireless networks are made using counters called shadow queues. The results are also extended to the case of networks that employ simple forms of network coding. In that case, our algorithm provides a low-complexity solution to optimally exploit the routing-coding tradeoff.",

The system converts text to speech with synchronized animation of mouth movements and emotion expression. The talking head is based on a generic 3D human head model. The personalized model is incorporated into the system. With texture mapping, the personalized model offers a more natural and realistic look than the generic model. To express emotion, both emotional speech synthesis and emotional facial animation are integrated and Chinese viseme models are also created in the paper. Finally, the emotional talking head system is created to generate the natural and vivid audio-visual output.",

    "abstract": "The identification and classification of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and non-PET plastic bottles is of great significance in recycling. Compared with RGB images, polarized images contain more information about the surface materials of objects. A recognition and classification method based on polarimetric vision combined with convolution neural network and image segmentation is proposed. Firstly, different polarization information is used to train a convolutional network, filter the polarization angle information as the most suitable training feature, and create an angle of polarization dataset of plastic bottles. Afterwards, the convolutional neural network is structurally optimized to achieve high accuracy in classifying plastic bottles. Further, to solve the problem of overlapping or contacting plastic bottles in practical inspection, this paper proposes an image segmentation method based on dynamic threshold segmentation and convex package defect detection to achieve high recognition accuracy. The optimized convolutional neural network combined with the image segmentation method can achieve a classification accuracy of 96.10%.",

Experimental results show that the recognition rate of the images acquired by polarization cameras can reach 99.28% and 100% respectively. The accuracy rate is improved compared to the method of classifying ordinary black and white images of coal and gangue with non-polarization characteristics.",

It is important to get up-to-date information about flooding and the flood level for flood preparation and prevention. In this paper, we propose an efficient method to determine the flood level from daily activity photos on social media. Our method is based on the idea of matching the water level with human pose to determine the level of severity of flooding. Extensive experiments conducted on the dataset of Multimodal Flood Level Estimation show the superiority of our proposed method. We achieve the first rank in MediaEval 2019 and this demonstrates the potential applications of our method to analyze flood information.",

They are particularly relevant to densely populated cities where most people live in compact spaces. This proposed research explores interactive interior textile surfaces as an adaptive media which can transform interiors via the change of colors, luminescence and surface design. This is done by investigating the integration of textile base material via embellishment techniques, such as embroidery and felting, with polymeric photonic fibers (POF) which enhance tactile quality without compromising on the technological functionality. Their flexible application methods mean that, it is adaptable to the rigid nature of polymeric photonic fibers. In addition, embroidery has the unique ability to arrange and combine threads together with various materials in non-rigid formations and multiple directions to create stable two-dimensional and three-dimensional forms [1]. Different materials can be combined to explore aesthetically pleasing surface designs, textures and achieve positive tactile quality.",
