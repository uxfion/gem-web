					The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, positioned as one of China's strategic priorities, has recently focused on improving medical service efficiency and reducing healthcare costs. Against this backdrop, Duying Medical is dedicated to enhancing the quality control standards of prenatal ultrasound diagnosis. Leveraging the advantages of Guangdong and Macao, the company has formulated intelligent quality control standards, key technologies, and a demonstration application research plan.<P>
					
					The plan aims to standardize and enhance prenatal ultrasound diagnosis, addressing challenges such as real-time evaluation issues in manual quality control, difficulties in disseminating high-level technology to grassroots hospitals, and challenges in seeking medical treatment at tertiary hospitals. By improving the accessibility of ultrasound screening in primary healthcare institutions, the project is poised to inject new momentum into the development of high-end medical ultrasound equipment in China, thereby enhancing international competitiveness.<p>
					
					
					Recently, the project "Research on Intelligent Quality Control Standards, Key Technologies, and Demonstration Applications of Fetal Ultrasound," led by Macau Polytechnic University and jointly applied by Riser Medical and Shenzhen University, has been approved, signaling its imminent launch with funding support. The core objective of the project is to construct an international science and technology innovation center within the Greater Bay Area over the next three years, focusing on addressing challenges in intelligent quality control standards, key technologies, and demonstration applications of fetal ultrasound images.<p>
					
					The approval of the project is not only crucial for improving the quality of prenatal ultrasound diagnosis but also underscores the Greater Bay Area's high regard for intelligent ultrasound technology. This initiative is expected to inject new impetus into independent innovation in science and technology in Guangdong and Macao, fostering deep cooperation in the technological domain between the two regions, and elevating the technological standards of the medical equipment industry. Additionally, the project creates favorable opportunities for collaborative partnerships in medical technology innovation, aiming to infuse new vitality into the medical technology field in the Greater Bay Area and promote the sustainable development of the entire industry.<p>
