					<p>Breast cancer is a pervasive malignancy worldwide, claiming numerous lives each year. Early and accurate detection of cancer through efficient and cost-effective methods is crucial in minimizing its impact. While mammography has been foundational in breast cancer diagnosis, there is still a need to improve its accuracy and efficiency, particularly in the detection and classification of calcifications and masses. These elements are critical indicators of potential malignancies, and their precise identification and classification are essential for effective treatment planning.

					</p>
					<p>The interpretation of mammographic images, especially the detailed analysis of calcifications and masses, requires specialized expertise. However, the limited availability of skilled radiologists and the growing demand for mammographic screenings highlight the necessity for a reliable and automated solution.</p>
					<p>To address this challenge, our project integrates artificial intelligence into mammographic image analysis. By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, we aim to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of detecting and classifying calcifications and masses in mammographic images. We employ a state-of-the-art deep learning model, specifically a modified version of the widely acclaimed U-Net, to achieve detailed segmentation and classification.</p>
					<p>The integration of AI in mammographic image analysis represents a significant advancement in breast cancer screening. Early detection through precise image analysis not only helps halt the disease's progression but also significantly enhances patient survival rates. Our project's outcomes have the potential to reduce the workload on radiologists, provide timely and accurate diagnoses, and ultimately improve the overall effectiveness of breast cancer management.</p>
					<p>Despite the promising potential of deep learning (DL) in medical image segmentation, continuous learning is necessary to adapt and improve its generalization for new tasks or datasets. In clinical practice, however, current DL methods often forget previously learned tasks when trained on new tasks due to the inaccessibility of previously used sensitive patient data, a phenomenon known as Catastrophic Forgetting (CF).</p>
					<p>To counter this, we introduce an innovative continual learning (CL) method that leverages high-quality pseudo-labels derived from new tasks, replacing previously inaccessible old data. We are the first to introduce Visual Mamba into continual learning in breast imaging, where it excels in feature extraction while guaranteeing efficient inference and maintaining low computational complexity. Additionally, we propose incorporating contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) embeddings, which are pre-trained on pairs of breast lesion images and their corresponding label texts. These embeddings encapsulate semantic information for each class and provide informative content through extensive joint training of image-text pairs.</p>
					<P>We evaluated our methods on five public mammogram datasets. Results show that the proposed approach improves performance on new tasks while maintaining robust performance on previously learned tasks, outperforming existing methods.</P>
